					<h3>Botnet</h3>
					<p> A network of compromised computers that is controlled by an attacker (the botmaster). </p>
					<aside class="notes">
						&lt;Definition of botnet>. The bots are spread all over the world which makes it nearly impossible to destroy the botnet. Many modern botnets also have the ability to update themselves, allowing them to avoid anti-virus and add new functionality.

					<h3>Botnet topologies</h3>

					<img height="40%" src="images/topology_p2p.png"/>
					
					<aside class="notes">
					There are various topologies that is used by botnet authors. The two main ones is centralized, also known as
					Command-and-Control, and peer to peer.
					In a centralized botnet, all the bots communicate with a central server. The server is responsible for sending
					commands to the bots and receiving data from them.
					In a Peer-to-Peer structure the bots comunicate with each other. The botmaster can use any bot to give
					a new command to the network.
					</aside>

					<h3>Botnet detection and defence</h3>
					<p> Same propagation mechanism as other malware </p>
					<p> Network monitoring </p>
					<p> Honeypots </p>
					<aside class="notes">
					Botnets make use of the same propagation mechanisms as other malware, which mean thay can be detected by antivirus programs.
					Network monitoring uses software to scan network traffic for known botnet patterns. Only efficient against botnets that do not blend in.
					Honeypots are machines that are infected on purpose. The behaviour and patterns of the botnet can then be studied by researchers.
					</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section>
				  <h3>Botnet detection and defence (II)</h3>
				  <p>Remove servers<p>
				  <p>Hijack a sever</p>
				  <p>Index poisoning<p>
				  <p>Sybil attack</p>
				  <aside class="notes">
				  The easiest way to neutralise of a Command-and-Control botnet is to get rid of the server it depends on. If the bots cannot connect to the server, they will not be able to do anything malicious.
				  A riskier strategy is to try to take over a server. This effectively gives you control over at least a part of the botnet. You can then try to get the botnet to destroy itself.
				  Peer-to-Peer networks have no centralized server, so the previously mentioned defenses are not affective against them. This is where the next two attacks come in.
				  Index poisoning is effecive against bot that uses the Peer-to-Peer architecture to pass on commands. The bots insert commands into the peer-to-peer table under predetermined indices to allow other bots to retrieve them.
				  Adding other data under the same indices will prevent bots from retrieving the commands.
				  A sybil attack inserts or replaces nodes in a P2P network in an attempt to monitor or change botnet traffic.

					<h3>Cloud computing</h3>
					<blockquote>Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.</blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">
					This is the NIST definition of cloud computing lt;Read definition>

				<section>
				  <h3>Cloud essential characteristics</h3>
				  <p>On-demand self service.</p>
				  <p>Broad access</p>
				  <p>Resource pooling</p>
				  <p>Rapid elasticity</p>
				  <p>Measured service</p>
				  <aside class="notes">
				  On demand self service: system will be given required resources without human intervention.
				  Broad access: cloud instance can be acessed through the internet on various devices.
				  Resource pooling: all available resources are added into a pool, from which any instance can draw.
				  Rapid elasticity: instances can acquire resources on-demand, allowing them t efficiently handle surges.
				  Measured service: clients only pay for resources they consume.

					<h3>Problem statement (reminder)</h3>
					<p>Companies can not easily monitor private cloud environments without changing the underlying architecture of the cloud.</p>

				<section>
				  <h3>The solution</h3>
				  <p>Use a botnet to collect data about employee usage from cloud instances.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
				  <h3>Solution</h3>
				  <p>Command and control topology</p>
				  <p>Bot initiates contact</p>
				  <img src="images/bsc.jpg"/>
				  <aside class="notes">
				    The solution uses a command-and-control topology, since data needs to be gathered in one place.
				    The bot initiates contact, since it might be behind a NAT or firewall that prevents the server from initiating.
